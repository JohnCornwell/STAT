# STAT

This repository contains my Master's Capstone project STAT. More information on what STAT does can be found in the [STAT](https://github.com/JohnCornwell/STAT) directory.

## Description

This repository contains the STAT project and software artifacts created in the software engineering process of developing STAT. The version of STAT in this repository does not contain the k-task simulation that would run when a user tires to test a swarm. The k-task simulation was developed by myself and others at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in partnership with Dr. Annie Wu at the University of Central Florida. Because the k-task simulation contains code and contributions from others, it is not included in this repository. The purpose of this repository is meant to show my knowledge of the software development process.

Included in this repository are several software artifacts that show how STAT was developed. In particular, the [capstone.pdf](https://github.com/JohnCornwell/STAT/blob/main/capstone.pdf) file contains the full summary of development and a good background of the project. This repository also contains a layered architecture in the [CapstoneArchitecture.pptx](https://github.com/JohnCornwell/STAT/blob/main/CapstoneArchitecture.pptx) PowerPoint file. The [CapstonePresentation.pptx](https://github.com/JohnCornwell/STAT/blob/main/CapstonePresentation.pptx) PowerPoint file contains my Capstone Defense presentation that was given as part of my Master's Degree requirements.

## Visuals

Below is an example of the full version of STAT running on a machine.
